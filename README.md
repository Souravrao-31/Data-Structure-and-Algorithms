### Hello Guys,

* This is the collection of Algorithms, Data Structures and Interview Questions with solutions.
* This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in C++.
* I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. 
* I have categorize all my algorithms in Data structure type.
* I am adding solutions continuously.


## Overview
The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of programs and algorithms implemented in C++. basic programs and competitive programming codes both are welcomed to contribute here.  

## Features

* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
* Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
* Each source code is atomic using [STL classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) and _no external libraries_ are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
* Source codes are [compiled and tested](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Awesome+CI+Workflow%22) for every commit on the latest versions of three major operating systems viz., Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu (Linux) using MSVC 16 2019, AppleClang 11.0 and GNU 7.5.0 respectively. 
* Strict adherence to [C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11) standard ensures portability of code to embedded systems as well like ESP32, ARM Cortex, etc. with little to no changes.
* Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.
* Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other applications.
